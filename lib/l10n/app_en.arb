  "articleUreaFull": "Urea is one of the most widely used nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture. It promotes rapid plant growth and enhances crop yield by providing a rich nitrogen source. Easy to apply and highly soluble, urea is suitable for various soil types. It supports the development of green, leafy crops, especially in cereals like wheat and rice. Urea is also cost-effective, making it ideal for both small and large-scale farmers. Regular use improves soil fertility when applied correctly and in balanced amounts. However, overuse of urea can lead to soil acidification and nutrient imbalance, so proper guidance and dosage are essential. Integrating it with organic matter or other balanced fertilizers can enhance its effectiveness while protecting soil health."
